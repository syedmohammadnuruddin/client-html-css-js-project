            <h2>What is Digital Printing?
            </h2>
            <p>Digital printing is a modern printing method that directly transfers digital files onto a variety of surfaces and materials. Unlike traditional printing processes, such as offset or flexography, digital printing does not require the creation of plates or screens. Instead, it relies on computer-controlled technology to reproduce high-resolution images, text, and graphics quickly and accurately.
            </p>
