            </p>
            <h2>What is Offset Printing?
            </h2>
            <p>Offset printing, also known as lithography, is a highly versatile and widely used printing technique that produces sharp, consistent, and vibrant printed materials. Unlike digital printing, which transfers an image directly onto paper, offset printing involves a more intricate process. It creates images through the interaction of ink and water on a printing plate, which is then transferred to a rubber blanket before being applied to the printing surface.
            </p>
            <h2>Why Choose Offset Printing with PrintSolutionsDXB?
            </h2>

            </p>
            <p><strong>Cost-Effective:</strong> For large print runs, offset printing offers significant cost advantages. The initial setup costs are offset by the lower per-unit cost for each printed item, making it a cost-effective choice for high-volume projects.
